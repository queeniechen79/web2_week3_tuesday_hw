                All of the citrus fruits are noted for their fragrance. 
                This is due to limonoids and flavonoids (both of which have strong antioxidant and antibacterial properties). 
                They can help prevent kidney stones, as they contain high levels of citrate. 
                Lemons are the highest, drinking diluted lemon juice daily has been shown to decrease kidney stone formation.
